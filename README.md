Game of Life
==================

The Game of Life isn't what you think, it's a program that simulates how cells might grow or die based on a small set of rules. This description if from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life):

>Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:   

>1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.   
>2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.   
>3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.   
>4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.   
>These rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:   
>1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.   
>2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.   
>3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

Install the Guido GUI Library
--------------------------------
Like Minesweeper the Game of Life is well suited to using a two dimensional array of buttons. We'll be using a GUI library called Guido. To install it, start *Processing* and choose *Sketch | Import Library | Add Library*. Type *Guido* in the search box, the click on *Guido by Florian Jenett* and then click *Install*.
